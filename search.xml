    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="The-very-first-need"><a href="#The-very-first-need" class="headerlink" title="The very first need"></a>The very first need</h3><p>I started building this blog site because my coursework required an online profile for career planning presentations. The truth is I have wanted to build a personal station for a long time, and this assignment just gave me a good motivation to start. </p>
<h3 id="Why-choose-Hexo"><a href="#Why-choose-Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Why choose Hexo?"></a>Why choose Hexo?</h3><p>To be honest, I did not know what to build with, there were so many options to choose from. I browsed many forums and many people recommended this framework because it is used by <mark>a large population</mark> and I am familiar with <mark>nodejs</mark>. So I chose this framework, even if there are problems in the future, I should be able to find a solution quickly.</p>
<h3 id="Get-started"><a href="#Get-started" class="headerlink" title="Get started"></a>Get started</h3><p>According to the official tutorial, I first installed the global hexo-cli.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install -g hexo-cli</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Then it was time to initialize the project.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">hexo init &lt;folder&gt;</span><br><span class="line">cd &lt;folder&gt;</span><br><span class="line">npm install</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Imported the very popular theme <mark><strong>NexT</strong></mark> into my project.</p>
<figure class="highlight yml"><figcaption><span>_config.yml</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">theme:</span> <span class="string">next</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Then it was time for the various configuration files.</p>
<img src="/2022/12/01/A-New-Start/configs.png" class="" width="600">

<p>For easy-configuration purposes, I made a copy of the full configuration file from <code>node_modules</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Setup-Github-pages"><a href="#Setup-Github-pages" class="headerlink" title="Setup Github pages"></a>Setup Github pages</h3><p>This step is relatively simple, I just need to configure the <strong><code>pages</code></strong> in <strong><code>settings</code></strong> to publish the project to the github space. Hexo also kindly included a tutorial on github configuration and the workflow code file corresponding to the <strong><code>Action</code></strong>. So, basically, all I need is to deal with the configuration files.</p>
<h3 id="Future-thoughts"><a href="#Future-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Future thoughts"></a>Future thoughts</h3><p>For now, I basically finished building this personal site, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. I found that the framework has a huge flaw - that is, the support for multiple languages is not friendly. I have consulted a lot of information, but the results are not satisfied. The solution I found now is to create two separate Hexo sites and link them together. Fortunately <strong><code>github pages</code></strong> can do this.</p>
<p>But it is annoying to execute the same command twice. In the future, I may build another github repo, merge the source files of the first two sites into one folder, and then write some scripts to simplify the operation process.</p>
